Woalid Hossin, and I am currently a student at Daffodil International University, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). I have been focusing my studies on web development, and recently, I have gained proficiency in the C programming language. I am proud to share that my hard work and dedication have paid off, as I have qualified for the final round of a prestigious programming contest. Apart from my academic pursuits, I also have a passion for fitness and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I find solace in the gym, dedicating time to exercise and improve my physical well-being. I believe in the importance of a balanced life, where I can excel both academically and physically. I am excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to further honing my programming skills while nurturing my passion for fitness."</p>
